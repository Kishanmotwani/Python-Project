# Bank Loan Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective / Abstract

This project explores a **bank loan dataset** to identify key patterns, trends, and relationships. The primary objectives include:

- Understanding the factors influencing loan approval and repayment.
- Investigating the likelihood of loan defaults.
- Identifying borrower characteristics associated with successful repayment.

By analyzing variables such as income, credit score, loan amount, demographics, and geographic information, actionable insights are provided to:

- Enhance loan decision-making processes.
- Improve risk assessment models.
- Optimize lending strategies.

The ultimate goal is to guide future lending policies and reduce financial risk for the bank.

## Key Findings & Conclusion

### Loan Approval Rate
- **69%** of loans were approved, reflecting a balanced lending policy.

### Gender vs. Loan Approval
- Gender had minimal impact on loan approval rates, with similar proportions for male and female applicants.

### Income Distribution
- Applicant and co-applicant incomes were right-skewed. Most applicants earned less than 10,000 units, with a few high-income outliers.

### Loan Amount Distribution
- Loan amounts varied widely, with most loans clustering at smaller amounts. A few outliers sought significantly larger loans.

### Education and Loan Status
- Graduates had higher approval rates than non-graduates, emphasizing education's role in perceived financial stability.

### Credit History Impact
- Credit history was a strong predictor of loan approval. Applicants with positive credit history were more likely to be approved.

### Property Area Analysis
- Urban areas had the highest number of loan applications, followed by semi-urban and rural areas.

### Income vs. Loan Amount
- A positive correlation exists between income and loan amount. Higher incomes generally led to larger loans.

### Self-Employment and Loan Approval
- Self-employed applicants had slightly lower approval rates, potentially due to perceived income instability.

### Dependents and Loan Status
- Dependents had limited impact on loan approvals. Applicants with no dependents had slightly better outcomes.
